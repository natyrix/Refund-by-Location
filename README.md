## Overview

This repository is used for week 10 challenge of 10Academy. The instructions for this project can be found in the challenge document.

The refund by location smart contract is aimed to be used when one party, for
example, an employer, agrees to pay another party, for example, an
employee, for being present in a certain geographic area for a certain
duration. The employeeâ€™s phone sends its GPS location to a smart contract at
a certain interval. Based on the pre-agreed contract codified in an Ethereum
smart contract, a cryptocurrency payment is executed when all the agreed
conditions are met.
If at any point, the GPS sensor indicates that an employee is outside the range
of the agreed GPS area, the contract state will be updated to indicate that it is
out of compliance.



## About

Produce an Ethereum based dApp that has both the smart contract tested
and deployed in a testnet and a front end that will allow monitoring of the
status.
